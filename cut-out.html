    <div class="checkerboard">
      <img id="initialImg" width="128" height="128" />

    <h1>Known Issues</h1>
    <ul>
      <!-- TODO fix this bug!  
        Disallow the drop with a warning saying why, or, better yet, find a way to make it work.  
        Maybe there is one queue for all the dropped files.  
        You can add to it while another part of the code is reading from it. -->
      <li>
        I would <i>not</i> try two large transfers at the same time.&nbsp; Let
        the first one finish before you start the second.
